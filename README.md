# Level Up Frontend
Welcome to the frontend of your level up assessment! 
This is a React.js web app that uses react-router-dom to simulate page routing.

This is a basic template for you to start off with. We have configured the routing for the pages, added some styling and a couple components but the rest is up to you!

Our designers have already created a design for you to replicate. You will find these designs in **designs.zip** and the link below
[Design Mockup](https://www.figma.com/design/HtbUsAXOZEBjEBTnnTkpq8/Level_Up_Frontend_Design)
We have setup tailwindcss for you to use as well.

You will find the needed images and assets in the **assets.zip** file.
